    "description": "Breakfast of champions (one of them)\n\nHeat oil in a large, deep, preferably ceramic, frying pan on medium heat\n\nCook onions until translucent, 5-10 min\n\nAdd minced meat, stir until lightly browned\n\nReduce heat a little, add jalapeño and bell pepper, cook until slightly soft. 3-4 min, do not overcook\n\nAdd garlic and tomato concentrate, stir for 2 min until tomato tastes cooked not raw\n\nAdd the wine. Tip: pour the wine into the tomato paste jar and shake it to get the last of the paste out.\n\nAdd canned tomatoes, cumin, caraway seeds, bay leaves, paprika, erythritol, concentrated stock, and pepper. Yes, that is a lot of cumin; it will be fine. Bring to low boil, reduce heat, simmer for 20 min\n\nPlace de-stemmed Swiss chard leaves on top of cooked tomato mixture. Make 8 small depressions with a spoon\n\nCrack one egg into each depression. Cover (a transparent lid is ideal)\n\nCook until egg white is _just_ set. Serve immediately, in the pan.\n\n- The tomato sauce keeps for a couple of days in the fridge. If eating over two days, crack only 4 eggs. Next time, reheat sauce then make 4 more depressions and crack the other 4.\n- We use Sukrin Gold erythritol, which looks and tastes like light brown sugar. If not low-carbing, demarara or other sugar can be substituted.\n- Bell peppers are bad for absorbing pesticides, so we always use organic because the skin is eaten.\n- The type of red wine is not critical, honestly. We use small (187ml) “individual” bottles of fairly cheap red wine.",

Reserve 1/4 cup (2 fl. oz./60 ml) of the sauce.\n\nPlace the salmon fillets in separate zip lock bags and pour the remaining sauce into the bags, dividing evenly. If you have time you can let them marinate for 1-4 hours, but you don’t have to.\n\nPrepare a sous vide immersion circulator for use according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Preheat the water to 122°F (50°C). Place the bags into the circulating water and cook for 40 minutes for medium doneness.\n\n5 minutes before the salmon is done, stir fry the bean sprouts in a large pan with a tsp of sesame oil and a splash of soy sauce. Divide evenly in two plates.\n\nOnce the salmon is done, sear the skin in the same pan for 30 seconds. Place each fillet on top of the bean sprouts and pour the saved sauce on it. Optionally, you can also use the sauce from the ziplock bags, but keep in mind it will be more watery (we did anyway).\n\nGarnish with the sliced spring onion and serve!\n\nNot low carbing?

    "description": "A delicious low carb treat!\n\n**Base:** \n1. In a medium frying pan, melt the ghee under low heat. \n2. Add the almond and coconut flour and stir continuously. \n3. It will look very runny at first, that's normal. When it starts darkening and becoming more viscous, add the cinnamon and sweetener. \n4. When it's light brown and most of the the ghee has been absorbed, it's about done. At that point, add the vanilla extract. It will foam, that's ok. Stir until it goes down again.\n5. Press into a 9\" springform cake tray. Let it cool down in the fridge.\n\n**Cream**: With a mixer beat the mascarpone on its own for a bit, then add icing sugar substitute to taste, then the rest of the ingredients. Blend until even. If you want the cheesecake to be extra fluffy, just beat it longer. Make sure the ghee in the bottom layer has solidified, then spread over the base in the cake tray. Put it back in the fridge.\n\n**Topping**: Blend half of the fruits and cut the other half into slices. Using a small pot, heat up the blended strawberries, Sukrin Gold, lemon juice and stir frequently until all heated up and mixed well. Add the gelatin slowly by sprinkling and stirring so that it doesn't clump. Then add the sliced fruits and stir. Simmer for a bit, then take it off the heat and let it cool down a bit. Once it starts getting viscous, spread it over the cream and put it back in the fridge.\n\nChill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, then enjoy!\n\n- We use Sukrin Gold and Sukrin Icing for sweetening. We've tried many and think those are as close as it gets to the sugar equivalents and have no aftertaste.\n- You can use less mascarpone, the middle layer will just be less thick. Adjust the rest of the quantities accordingly in that case.",
